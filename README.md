# My Portfolio Website

This website is created using HTML, CSS as I am good in only these two :)


-> You can access the GitHub hosted page version of my website on:
[GitHub](https://aestroix.github.io/My-portfolio-website/)

-> I have tried using almost everything that I learnt in 
#### _" Progate Code & Build Web Development Week "_

Some of the skills that I used in it are:

- [x] FLEXBOX
- [x] MEDIA QUERIES
- [x] CSS
- [x] HTML
- [x] ANIMATIONS

-> The major thing is that you enjoy what you do and I think I enjoyed the week of WEB DEV so much, that I am going to make some more projects real soon.
